# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project demonstrates brain tumor detection from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python with Keras.

## 📁 Project Files

- `Brain.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook containing the CNN model code.
- `Brain_Tumor_Detection_report.pdf` – Detailed project report.
- `Presentation1.pptx` – Project presentation slides.
- `images/` – Folder containing MRI scan samples and model output screenshots.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV
- Google Colab (or local Jupyter)
- PowerPoint and PDF for documentation

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open `Brain.ipynb` using Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. The model will train and predict tumor presence from test images.

## 🧾 Report Summary

This project aims to classify MRI images to detect brain tumors using deep learning. The CNN model achieved high accuracy and helped visualize tumor detection effectively.
